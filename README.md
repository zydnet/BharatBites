## 🌟 About

BharatBites is a digital platform dedicated to showcasing the rich variety of nutritious indigenous foods produced in India. This app bridges the gap between wholesome local foods and those who need them most — especially students and working professionals juggling hectic schedules and challenging diets.

Born from a personal journey battling acid reflux triggered by poor eating habits, BharatBites highlights the incredible health benefits of makhanas (fox nuts) — a superfood with roots in Bihar, which produces nearly 90% of the world's supply! This inspired the vision of a platform that celebrates India's nutritional heritage while empowering healthier choices.

By connecting users with indigenous superfoods, BharatBites promotes better health, awareness, and national pride. 🌾💚
